In my ADS Final Project at Northeastern University for Spring 2024, I developed a practical application that simplifies interacting with PDF documents. My project leverages LangChain and Streamlit technologies to create a chatbot that allows users to upload PDFs and inquire about their content. This chatbot is crafted to assist users in easily finding and understanding information within PDFs.

The primary feature of my project is its ability to break down the text in PDFs into smaller sections, convert these sections into data that the computer can process, and then utilize this data to provide the most relevant answers to user queries. It's akin to having a dialogue with the document where the chatbot interprets and responds to questions. This tool is not only useful for students and researchers who need to quickly extract and analyze information from documents but also for anyone who interacts with lengthy PDF files and seeks a more manageable approach. My project demonstrates the application of advanced tools to enhance our interaction with digital documents.
